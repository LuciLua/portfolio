        I started programming in 2020, when I had the opportunity to be
        taking the Instrumental Multimedia subject within the arts course at
        UFJF, where I study until today. Shortly after falling in love with it, I returned to
        study python, my first programming language, in addition to
        continue to delve deeper into web development, learning NodeJS,
        NextJS among others. One of the technologies I liked the most and I always use
        that I can is the Vercel website, where I deploy my projects to
        public access.
